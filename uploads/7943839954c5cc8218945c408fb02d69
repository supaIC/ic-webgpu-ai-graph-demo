What kind of future do we want?
do you want your data to be owned and controlled by centralized entities? or do you want a world where you own your identity, data, and have freedom? This is the choice we are faced with now. There are forces battling for the future. At Upstreet, we believe in accelerating towards building the future we want to see, which involves building the metaverse and ai on ethical techincalogy stacks that are distrubuted and free. 

Mission:

An open, decentralized, community-governed metaverse that provides a viable alternative to next-generation metaverse projects owned, tracked, and monetized by giant multinational corporations.
